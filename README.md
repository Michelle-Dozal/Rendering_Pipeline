# Rendering Pipeline
>This project was completed while taking CS130 (Computer Graphics) at University of California, Riverside in Winter 2021 with Dr.Tamar Shinar. The main purpose of the course was to become familiar and comfortable using physics and vector knowledge to render a 3D pieline.

## General
The main purpose of this project was to use generate 2D/3D objects using pixels by their light movement. Also known as "ray-tracing" and was implemented using shading/rays/physics concepts to bring it to life. 

Implementing Things like
* Vertex and Fragment Shading Calls
* Rasterization and Interpolation
* Clipping
* Using a z-buffer for Hidden Surfaces

## Some Tests 
TBA

## Usage

This project comes with a grading script, which you can run like this: ```./grading-script.py .``` and you will see all the tests that are passed.

### Technologies
* C++
* Python (for grading script)
